# Pseudo inverse method for 7-DOF manipulator
A kinematics inverse solution for 7-DOF manipulator based on pseudo inverse with joint limit avoidance and singularity avoidance.
Implementation platform: **Matlab 2019b**

Joint limit avoidance: use Gradient projection method （GPM）.

singularity avoidance：use weighted least-norm method （WLN）.
