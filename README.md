# Pseudo inverse method for 7-DOF manipulator
Developed by: Xinyang Tian.

Platform: Matlab 2019b.  

A kinematics inverse solution for 7-DOF manipulator based on **pseudo inverse** with joint limit avoidance and singularity avoidance.  
- **Joint limit avoidance**: use Gradient projection method （GPM）.
- **Singularity avoidance**: use weighted least-norm method （WLN）.
## Implementation
The code is implemented in MATLAB R2019b. Also, other versions of Matlab are available.
