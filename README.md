# Pseudo inverse method for 7-DOF manipulator
Developed by: Xinyang Tian.

Platform: Matlab 2019b.
# Implementation
A kinematics inverse solution for 7-DOF manipulator based on pseudo inverse with joint limit avoidance and singularity avoidance.

- Joint limit avoidance: use Gradient projection method （GPM）.

- singularity avoidance：use weighted least-norm method （WLN）.
